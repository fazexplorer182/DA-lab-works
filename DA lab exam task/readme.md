Here we have a dataset that contains placement data of students in a XYZ campus. It includes the educational information of each student, information about whether the student got placed or not,and the salary offered to the student.

The dataset is taken from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement.


**OBJECTIVE**


Here initially I have to do the data cleaning and then do the visualizations onthe given data. By doing visualization itself we can find some properties in the data.Then I will try building some machine learning models on the given data.Then I will compare the accuracy scores I obtained with different data.From them,I will choose the model that gives the best accuracy score.
