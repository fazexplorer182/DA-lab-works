Here we have a dataset thatcontains placementdata of students in a XYZ campus. It includes the educational informationof each student, information about whether the student got placed or not,and the salary offered to the student.
The dataset is taken from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement
OBJECTIVEHere initially Ihave to do the data cleaning and then do the visualizations onthe givendata. By doing visualization itself we can find some properties in the data.ThenI will try building some machine learning models on the given data.Then Iwill compare the accuracy scores Iobtained with different data.Fromthem,I will choose the model that gives the best accuracy score.
